# rock-paper-scissors
Simple rock paper scissors game that I will add a GUI to later down the road

I will attempting to create a rock, paper, scissors game that will play in the console. I will be returning to this project
later and creating a GUI and make it function in the browser. 

Some goals that I want to acomplish while doing this project

-I want to understand the problem I am trying to solve
    -I will write out my problem in plain english before converting to code

-I want to plan out how I am going to solve the problem first.
    -I will write a pseudocode and only then will I begin writing code

-From there I will tackle one by one my problems and work my way up to my big problem which is a rock paper scissors game.

-An example of a pseudocode = 'Write a program that takes a userâ€™s input and prints the numbers from one to the number the user entered. However, for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.'

-I will try to commit more to make a healthier commit history instead of finishing a whole project and commiting when finished. This will be a good habit to
get into

-I will not look at other's code. All code will be my own of course referencing JS guides.

-I will attempt to make the code as clean as possible
